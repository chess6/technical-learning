# Lesson / visualization correctness checklist

Copy this section for each new or substantially changed visualization surface.
Do not mark complete until every applicable item is done.

Reference both standards: [LESSON_DESIGN.md](./LESSON_DESIGN.md) (pedagogy,
notation, visual language) and [MATH_CORRECTNESS.md](./MATH_CORRECTNESS.md)
(mathematics), plus [ERROR_LOG.md](./ERROR_LOG.md) (known failure modes).

## Mathematical review

- [ ] Formulas independently verified (hand calc or known identity)
- [ ] Shared utilities from `src/math` used for all linear algebra
- [ ] No hardcoded geometry that conflicts with the mathematical model
- [ ] Basis-column convention verified (\(A\mathbf{e}_1\) / \(A\mathbf{e}_2\) = columns)
- [ ] Determinant / eigen edge cases checked where the surface touches them
- [ ] Identity→\(A\) interpolation labelled as a visual transition if used

## Visual review

- [ ] Labels match numeric values / KaTeX readouts
- [ ] Arrows point to computed endpoints
- [ ] Grid families align with transformed basis vectors
- [ ] No clipping or misleading overlap of critical labels
- [ ] Screen-\(y\) inversion does not alter mathematical meaning
- [ ] Animation intermediate states are labelled honestly

## Testing review

- [ ] Unit tests for pure math helpers
- [ ] Invariant tests (`src/math/invariants.ts`) for the relevant properties
- [ ] Asymmetric matrix covered (`[[1,2],[3,4]]` or `diagnostic-asymmetric`)
- [ ] Singular / collapse case covered when relevant
- [ ] Browser test for learner-visible readouts when UI is involved
- [ ] [ERROR_LOG.md](./ERROR_LOG.md) entry added if fixing a math/visualization bug

## Teaching review

- [ ] Visualization does not imply a false mathematical statement
- [ ] Readouts and explanation text agree
- [ ] Learner-facing notation uses KaTeX where appropriate

- [x] Collapse / negative det states labelled honestly

### Testing review

- [x] Unit tests (`m5-classify`, `DeterminantExplorer`)
- [x] Invariant / area tests via `assertUnitSquareAreaMatchesDeterminant`
- [x] Asymmetric matrix covered (`diagnostic-asymmetric`)
- [x] Singular / collapse covered

### Teaching review

- [x] Does not imply false statements about det
- [x] Readouts and explanation text agree
- [x] KaTeX used for learner-facing notation
- [x] Quality-bar focus applied (script-event beats, attention focus helpers, ghost-square continuity, name-after-intuition, Lesson 2 column callback, successive diagonal area stages) — see `docs/animation-quality-bar.md`

## Lesson 4 — Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues (M5 + Chapter 1 depth)

### Mathematical review

- [x] Formulas independently verified (\(A\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}\))
- [x] Shared utilities from `src/math` (`analyzeEigen2x2`, classify helpers)
- [x] Derivation spine: `characteristicPolynomial2x2`, `characteristicRoots2x2`, `matrixShift`, `nullspaceBasis2x2` (`Subspace2D`), `eigenDerivation2x2`
- [x] No TeX/prose in `src/math` — formatting in `eigenFormat.ts`
- [x] No hardcoded eigendirections independent of analysis
- [x] Eigenpairs verified with `assertEigenpair` / `verifiesEigenpair`
- [x] Eigen edge cases: zero vector, λ=0, scalar (`plane`), defective (`line`), complex/no-real
- [x] Asymmetric lesson matrix: λ=3 → (1,0); λ=2 → multiple of (−1,1)
- [x] Visual transitions labelled; complex case states complex eigenvalues may exist

### Visual review

- [x] Labels match numeric / KaTeX readouts
- [x] Eigendirection dashes + arrows from `summarizeEigenAnalysis` / derivation
- [x] Derivation scene embeds in worked example (not a second top-level Watch)
- [x] Off-axis λ=2 direction explicitly labelled in scene + callouts
- [x] Static `EigenSolutionDiagram` for practice reveals
- [x] Stable direction normalization (`stabilizeDirection`)
- [x] Safe framing; reduced-motion via shared player
- [x] Screen-\(y\) inversion only in render mapping
- [x] Defective / no-real cases labelled honestly (no fabricated second direction)

### Testing review

- [x] Unit tests (`eigen.test.ts` derivation helpers, `m5-classify`, `EigenvectorExplorer`)
- [x] `sceneTimings.test.ts` for derivation ladder metadata
- [x] Wiring: worked example `guidedSceneId`, tiers, callouts
- [x] Component tests: DepthLayer, MisconceptionCallout, SolutionReveal, ExercisePanel eigenvalue
- [x] `assertEigenpair` on displayed directions
- [x] Distinct-real covered via `eigen-distinct`
- [x] λ=0 covered via `eigen-zero` preset
- [x] Browser test `e2e/lesson-eigenvectors.spec.ts` (worked computation + tiers)
- [x] No new ERROR_LOG bug found during depth expansion

### Teaching review

- [x] Zero vector never presented as an eigenvector
- [x] Readouts and explanation text agree
- [x] KaTeX used for \(A\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}\)
- [x] Worked example teaches computation with faded second example
- [x] Misconception confrontations at natural points (axes, reverse, defective)
- [x] Concept-graph callbacks to determinants (collapse), span, transformations
- [x] Tiered practice: check / drill / transfer with solution visuals
- [x] Depth layers (connection, looking-ahead, math-note, trap)

### 3D extension + expand modal (Lesson 4 clip polish)

- [x] 3D objective named: in three dimensions, an eigendirection is still a line that maps onto itself
- [x] 2D derivation vs 3D extension non-equivalence made explicit (different curated \(3\times 3\) example; labels "2D derivation" / "See it in 3D")
- [x] Curated matrix \(A=1.5P\) documented; \(\chi_A(t)=(t-1.5)(t^2+1.5t+2.25)\) with negative quadratic discriminant verified in tests
- [x] Semantic `majorStepId` synchronization (not raw timeline progress across scenes)
- [x] Single-renderer lifecycle (inline unmounts while modal open; Motion Canvas dispose verified)
- [x] WebGL-unavailable fallback + retry path (`forceUnavailable` / jsdom)
- [x] Constrained OrbitControls + Reset view; reduced-motion disables damping auto-motion
- [x] Expand modal scoped to Lesson 4 eigen clips only
- [x] Unit tests: `eigen3.test.ts`, `EigenClipStage.test.tsx`; e2e coverage for modal + 3D entry

#### Clip readability pass (2026-07-20)

- [x] 3D vectors carry real cone arrowheads + on-object labels (`v`, `Av = 1.5 v`,
  `eigenline (1,1,1)`); a color→meaning legend backs up the roles (no color-only cues)
- [x] 3D colours aligned with the 2D `--role-*` tokens (input=original, image=transformed,
  eigenline=selected); camera looks roughly perpendicular to (1,1,1) so the line reads as spatial
- [x] `shift-collapse` draws the image plane explicitly (translucent quad with normal (1,1,1))
  and frames the eigendirection as the nullspace of `A − λI`; caption/legend wording precise
- [x] New math regressions in `eigen3.test.ts`: single application scales length ×1.5 and turns
  ordinary vectors (not a spiral), `v`/`Av` stay collinear, cube collapses into `x+y+z=0`
- [x] 2D Watch scene shows an honest `λ` readout tied to geometry (tip length = λ · ghost length)
  on the highlight/stretch/reverse/collapse beats; captions made symbol-first (not color-named)
