# Lesson / visualization correctness checklist

Copy this section for each new or substantially changed visualization surface.
Do not mark complete until every applicable item is done.

Reference both standards: [LESSON_DESIGN.md](./LESSON_DESIGN.md) (pedagogy,
notation, visual language) and [MATH_CORRECTNESS.md](./MATH_CORRECTNESS.md)
(mathematics), plus [ERROR_LOG.md](./ERROR_LOG.md) (known failure modes).

## Mathematical review

- [ ] Formulas independently verified (hand calc or known identity)
- [ ] Shared utilities from `src/math` used for all linear algebra
- [ ] No hardcoded geometry that conflicts with the mathematical model
- [ ] Basis-column convention verified (\(A\mathbf{e}_1\) / \(A\mathbf{e}_2\) = columns)
- [ ] Determinant / eigen edge cases checked where the surface touches them
- [ ] Identity→\(A\) interpolation labelled as a visual transition if used

## Visual review

- [ ] Labels match numeric values / KaTeX readouts
- [ ] Arrows point to computed endpoints
- [ ] Grid families align with transformed basis vectors
- [ ] No clipping or misleading overlap of critical labels
- [ ] Screen-\(y\) inversion does not alter mathematical meaning
- [ ] Animation intermediate states are labelled honestly

## Testing review

- [ ] Unit tests for pure math helpers
- [ ] Invariant tests (`src/math/invariants.ts`) for the relevant properties
- [ ] Asymmetric matrix covered (`[[1,2],[3,4]]` or `diagnostic-asymmetric`)
- [ ] Singular / collapse case covered when relevant
- [ ] Browser test for learner-visible readouts when UI is involved
- [ ] [ERROR_LOG.md](./ERROR_LOG.md) entry added if fixing a math/visualization bug

## Teaching review

- [ ] Visualization does not imply a false mathematical statement
- [ ] Readouts and explanation text agree
- [ ] Learner-facing notation uses KaTeX where appropriate
